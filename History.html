                    <p>
                        The UFC began as an idea developed by Art Davie, a businessman interested
                        in staging a real contest between different martial arts disciplines. He 
                        partnered with Rorion Gracie, a co-founder of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and Robert
                        Meyrowitz, head of Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG). Their goal was to
                        create a tournament that would showcase the most effective martial art in 
                        real combat.The result was UFC 1, held on November 12, 1993, in 
                        Denver, Colorado. The event featured minimal rules, no weight classes, 
                        and fighters from various backgrounds. Royce Gracie’s early dominance 
                        introduced Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to a global audience and shaped the foundations
                        of MMA.

                    <p>
                        Following its debut, the UFC quickly grew in popularity but also attracted
                        criticism due to its violent presentation. Politicians such as Senator John
                        McCain openly opposed the events, calling them “human cockfighting.”
                        Under increasing pressure, many states banned the UFC, and cable companies
                        dropped pay-per-view support. During this period, SEG attempted to rebrand
                        the sport by adding rules, weight classes, and rounds. Despite these 
                        efforts, financial instability grew, putting the future of the organization
                        at risk.

                    <p>
                        In 2001, Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta acquired the struggling UFC through
                        their company Zuffa LLC andappointed Dana White as president. This 
                        executive team modernized the organization through:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Adoption of the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts</li>
                                <li>Expansion of weight classes</li>
                                <li>Stronger athletic commission oversight</li>
                                <li>Improved production, promotion, and fighter marketing</li>
                            </ul>
                        A pivotal moment came in 2005 with the debut of The Ultimate Fighter on
                        Spike TV. The season’s finale, featuring Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan 
                        Bonnar, is widely credited with catapulting the UFC into mainstream 
                        popularity.Throughout this period, major stars such as Chuck Liddell, 
                        Randy Couture, Tito Ortiz, Matt Hughes, Georges St-Pierre, Anderson Silva, 
                        Brock Lesnar, and Jon Jones helped fuel rapid growth. The UFC expanded 
                        globally, adding new divisions and hosting events across Europe, Australia,
                        Brazil, Canada, and Asia.

                    <p>
                        The UFC continued to grow into a polished global sports brand. New 
                        champions such as José Aldo, Cain Velasquez, Ronda Rousey, and Demetrious 
                        Johnson brought visibility to lighter weight classes and women’s MMA.
                        The emergence of Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov produced some of 
                        the biggest pay-per-view events in history. During this time, the UFC also 
                        signed broadcast deals with Fox Sports and expanded its digital footprint 
                        through UFC Fight Pass.

                    <p>
                        In 2016, Zuffa sold the UFC to WME-IMG (now Endeavor) in a landmark 
                        multi-billion-dollar deal. Executives Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell 
                        took significant leadership roles while Dana White remained as president.
                        Under Endeavor, the UFC:
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                        The organization has grown into the premier MMA promotion worldwide, 
                        becoming a centerpiece of global combat sports and a dominant player in

                    <p>
